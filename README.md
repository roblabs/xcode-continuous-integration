# `xcode-continuous-integration`

Goal â€” *one button Xcode builds*.

We all want simple builds.  If you are able to check your code into a `git` repo, then it should be able to `git pull` and build in small number of steps.  If you can minimize the number of dependencies to be installed or to be `fetch`ed, then your builds will be more repeatable.  More repeatable; possibly better quality.  More repeatable; prime for automation with Xcode Server *Bots*.

This repo includes CI scripts for use in Xcode Continuous Integration *Bots*.  Also useful for manual builds.  Support for `carthage` for fetching binaries.  If you CocoaPods, you can still use this repo.  It's likely you can still use this as you will likely be using the CocoaPods `.xcworkspace`, which this can still be integrated into.

### Xcode Server and Continuous Integration Guide

* [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/)

### How to Use the Repo

1.  Add this repo as a `git submodule`.  The directory name it creates will be `xcode-continuous-integration` and the shell scripts will be in that directory.

```
# Add repo to the current directory
git submodule add https://github.com/roblabs/xcode-continuous-integration.git
```

2. In Xcode

  2.1 `Edit Scheme` > `Build` > `Pre-Actions` > `Run Script` > Add the following (assuming the proper path relative to your `${PROJECT_DIR}`)

```
cd ${PROJECT_DIR}
git submodule update --init --recursive
wait
sh ${PROJECT_DIR}/xcode-continuous-integration/ci.sh
```
